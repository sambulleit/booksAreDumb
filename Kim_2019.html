  <h2>Large Format Photography // 2019 // Greenville, Indiana</h2>
  <h3>This was one of my first attempts of large format portraiture. I wanted to shoot 4x5 to take advantage of how tedious the format was. It didn't end up working in the long run, but I ended up getting to treat this project more like a painting than a photo shoot. Every aspect of the frame and the subject was taken into account over the course of a two month planning period. Even though it's a photo of one of my exes, I'm still very proud of it. Looking back on it, there's so much here that captures the better parts of our relationship in ways I think only the two of us would understand. It's amazing how true that old clich√© about about how an image can freeze a moment forever really is.</h3>
