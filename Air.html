  <h1> "Air"</h1>
  <h2>35mm Photography // 2019 // Georgetown, Indiana</h2>
  <h3>This was an experiment in emulsion. I'd gotten my hands on a TON of old, still usable Polaroid instant 35mm rolls. Thirty years expired but still a lot of fun for peanuts compared to what that stuff is actually worth. I took a roll of the B&W out in my Nikon F4 just to see what I could do with texture on that stuff. I took this very grungey shot of a gas station air pump, and I'm kind of obsessed with it. More and more I see my work get cleaner, tighter, better composed. That's extremely easy to do once you've spent awhile trying. What's so much harder to do is make something like this. Clean work doesn't make me feel like this. A grainy, low dynamic range shot is technically easy to pull off. Just shoot off a roll of Delta 3200 and you're done. This isn't that. This is more present, more challenging. Sometimes, I wish I made more work like it. More than anything though, I miss experimenting with the technology behind photography as much as I used to.</h3>
