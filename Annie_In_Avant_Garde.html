  <h1> "Annie in Avant Garde</h1>
  <h2>Digital Photography // 2018 // Greenville, Indiana</h2>
  <h3>I made this photograph of my sister initially for a Tamron photographer contest in hopes of winning an extra portrait lens. She was home from school for the day, and for a long time she was the only person I had who would willingly model for me. I took advantage of the opportunity and told her that we were going to have a beauty shoot. She asked me what kind of look she should put together while I was getting ready. I told her to do whatever she felt like. It's better to give your subject control in their shoot.</h3>
