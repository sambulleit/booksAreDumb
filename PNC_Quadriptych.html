  <h1> "PNC Quadriptych"</h1>
  <h2>Digital Photography Collage // 2018 // Louisville, KY</h2>
  <h3>This is another abstract composition I made of architectural work. I think it was one of the first ones I made with multiple exposure, but I'm not sure. What I do remember is when I made it or rather who I made it with. My friend, and newly BFA-touting ceramicist, Brooklin asked me to go out and shoot with her around downtown Louisville one night after work. I still needed every opportunity I could take to fill up my admissions portfolio and we hadn't been out together in long time, so of course I said yes. Now this is one of the photos I look back on and think of her. I'm glad we've been friends for so long even if we don't hardly get to talk. I think she's taught me more about being an artist than she probably knows, even though I've been in the art world much, much longer than she has. She's a true artist and I'm extremely proud to know her. It's important to make artist friends.</h3>
