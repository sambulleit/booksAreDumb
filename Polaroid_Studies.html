  <h1> "Polaroid Studies"</h1>
  <h2>Digital Scanner // 2018 // Greenville, Indiana</h2>
  <h3>This was an early effort in experimental photographic technique, pushing the limits of my equipment, and making the best of a bad situation. I had a couple of non-returnable packs of SX70 film after my Polaroid SX70 died on me mid-shoot. I ended up trying a variety of tools to spread the developer across the emulsion by hand, just to see what would happen. The results you see here, and are 12800 DPI scans of 1/8" areas of each finished Polaroid, showing the crystals, dyes, and chemical reaction formed by polaroid developer. I think they're very beautiful. Sometimes in photography it helps not to use a camera at all.</h3>
